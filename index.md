## About Me

I am currently a PhD student at [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](http://www.mbzuai.ac.ae). At MBZUAI, I am affliated with the [Intelligent Visual Analytics Lab (IVAL)](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/) where I am primarily advised by [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/). My secondary advisor is [Dr. Fahad Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home). 

I received my Masters degree in Wireless Communications  from the [Lunds Teckniska Hogskola , LTH, Sweden](https://www.lth.se/). After graduation, I worked as a System Engineer at ACES, Pakistan) before again transitioning  into academia in 2020 and joining MBZUAI as a PhD student  under [Dr. Salman Khan](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9dfn5GkAAAAJ&hl=en)



## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Multi-modal Generative and Discriminative learning in the realm of Label-efficiency with applications to problems in 1. Test-time out-of-distribution generalization, 2. Unifying generative and discriminative spaces. 3. World-centric evaluation of Multi-modal models and 4. Self-supervised learning. 

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->
